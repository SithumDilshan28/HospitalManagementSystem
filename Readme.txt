It generates reports on various aspects, including patient demographics, appointment statistics, revenue, and resource utilization. These reports assist in monitoring and optimizing hospital operations, enabling data-driven decision-making.

The Hospital Management System, developed as a client project, demonstrates the ability to create a robust and user-friendly online hospital management website using PHP. With its diverse features, including patient registration, appointment scheduling, EHRs, and billing, this web application streamlines hospital processes, enhances patient care, and improves overall operational efficiency.
